The attacks were also thought to be intended to destabilize the nation just as it was beginning to stabilize politically and economically. In Jakarta alone at least seven churches were damaged in separate blasts. Bombs also exploded in Batam, West Java, Sumatra, and several other cities. All of the bombings occurred between 9:00 and 9:30 pm. A total of 15 people were killed and at least 96 injured. Those wounded and killed included children and several policemen. The bombings were condemned strongly even by the Muslim Extremist group, Jihad Warrior. On Dec. 26, authorities in Bangung announced that they were detaining two individuals for questioning and possibly for involvement in the attacks. The two suspects were in the hospital, as they were wounded in the attack as well. One of the two admitted to attending planning meetings for the bombing and said that the bomb set-up included yellow powder, carbon, an alarm clock, and a cell phone. The detonation was done using a timer and a cell phone. On Jan. 17, the Jakarta Post stated that they had arrested eight suspects in connection with the Christmas Eve bomb attacks. At least one of the suspects admitted his involvement in the bomb preparation. On Jan. 23, Police investigators announced that they believed the individual responsible for planning the attacks was in Malaysia. Throughout the investigation, there was much speculation on who had perpetrated the attacks.

A final theory blamed members of the police and Philippine's Senate for the attacks.

February 6 2004,40,122,"Moscow, Russia","February 2004 Moscow Metro bombing: A blast tore apart a metro train car in Moscow during the morning rush hour. The train was traveling between the Paveletskaya station and the Avtozavodskaya station around 8:40 am. The explosion occurred in the second car of the train, blowing out windows and causing metal pieces of the train to be strewn in all directions. The device had an explosive power of about 4–5 kg of TNT. The device was similar to that used in the commuter train attack in Yessentuki in 2003. Those who survived were forced to walk through the dark tunnel to exit the subway. At least forty people were killed and 122 injured. However, the death toll was expected to rise as many bodies had been torn apart during the explosion and were difficult to identify. Police believe that they have surveillance video of two of the perpetrators. The video shows two suspicious looking people boarding the train with briefcases. In addition to these two people, police had also identified one other suspect, also a woman. The main theory of investigators was that the blast was perpetrated by suicide bombers, probably the two women companions of the man caught on video. However, other theories, including the possibility that the bomb was set on time delay and placed in a briefcase, were also being considered. Police had released a photograph of the male suspect. On February 8, the case was transferred to the FSB, as officials felt that they were unlikely to find the suspect in Moscow. Instead, they were hoping to gain information from other regions. Although Russian officials believe that Chechen rebels were behind the attack, particularly terrorists affiliated with Abu al-Walid al-Ghalidi, Chechen leaders deny involvement. Some officials speculated that the attack had occurred in an attempt to disrupt the upcoming March elections. Putin vowed that this would not happen. There was also some speculation that there was a connection between al-Qaida and this incident. On March 1, several sources reported that a previously unknown terrorist group, known as Gazoton-Murdash (a Chechen group), claimed responsibility for the incident. A statement was received first on February 8, and then several times after that. Kavkaz-Tzentr did not publish the letter until it had been received three times along with a phone call. The leader of the group said that the attack was intended to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the killing of Chechen civilians by Russian soldiers who took control of Groznyy. Chechen authorities were unsure if the group was a valid organization and were attempting to ascertain the true identity of the group leader, Lom-Ali Chechensky, and determine if the claim of responsibility is accurate. On March 4, Izvestiya reported that the statement of Lom-Ali was actually a reaction to the reported killing of Ruslan Gelayev in Dagestan. The source stated that this claim of responsibility was only propaganda, used to deflect attention from the killing of Gelayev and as retaliation for Russian propaganda. On September 28, Officials announced that they believed Anzor Izhayev was responsible for the blast. They believe that he died in the attack. The suspicion was based on genetic tests.[1]",Riyadus-Salihiin,Second Chechen War

At least one of these bombs detonated at El Pozo, a small commuter station in Madrid. It is impossible to disaggregate the casualties from any of the blast sites because of poor reporting. The bombs were detonated by cell phones and were left in backpacks.

In their claim of responsibility, the Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigade says that Spain was targeted because of their cooperation with the US in the war in Iraq. In response to the attacks, the ruling Spanish party was defeated in elections mainly because they lied about those attacks(which took place four days after the incident) and the new Prime Minister vowed to remove Spanish troops from combat in Iraq.

May 9 2004,10,56,"Grozny, Russia","2004 Grozny stadium bombing: A bomb exploded in the Dynamo stadium in the Chechen capital, Groznyy, killing the republic's president Akhmad Kadyrov. Kadyrov was elected last fall in what was considered by many to be a fraudulent vote. The explosion was caused by a bomb planted inside a concrete pillar and occurred at 10:35am during a parade and concert in Groznyy celebrating the 59th anniversary of the victory of Germany in World War 2. The blast tore a hole in the section designate for dignitaries. It was not clear if the explosion was specifically targeting Kadyrov or whether it would have occurred regardless of his presence, as he was not officially scheduled to be at this event. Khussein Isayev, chairman of the Republic's state council, and Adlan Khasanov, a reported for Reuters, were also killed in the blast. Col. Gen. Valery Baranov, the commander of the Russian military in the northern Caucasus was gravely wounded. Although estimates of total casualties varied, at least ten people were killed and around fifty more injured. These numbers include many civilians and WW2 veterans who were also attending the celebrations. Officials believe that the blast was detonated by remote control and was intentionally installed below the VIP section. The bomb may have been planted some time ago during the recent renovations to the stadium. Preliminary reports suggest that the bomb was equivalent to one ton of TNT. The location of the bomb made it impossible for existing equipment to detect. The type of explosive appeared identical to the type used to blow up the military parade two years ago in the Dagestani city of Kaspiysk. Rescue workers prevented two other blasts in the stadium. They were able to defuse another landmine and an additional explosive device equipped with a timer set to go off 30 minutes after the first explosion. On May 12, another explosive device was found in the half-ruined Dynamo Stadium. The device consisted of TNT charges and pieces of metal. It was unclear if the device had been planted recently or a long time ago. Rebel leader Shamil Basayev claimed that he was involved in and had organized the blast. The attack may have been intended to sow panic and disorder among the Chechen leadership. Initial investigations were focusing on the security staff at the stadium and the builders who took part in the renovations of the stadium. Investigators believe that insufficient training and organization of the security staff was faulted for allowing the attack to occur. Officials had detained at least five individuals for potential involvement in the attack, including Ibragim Musayev, who was also involved in the hostage-taking raid of the Dubrovka Theatre and the bomb attack near a McDonald's in Moscow. Investigators had also given a more specific list of suspects who were under investigation to the Russian Duma. The Russian appointed Prime Minister, Sergei Abramov will serve as President until new elections are held sometime before September, as stipulated by the republic's constitution. The attack serves a blow to Putin and his strategy for ending the conflict in Chechnya. On August 5, Interfax reported that three suspects had been arrested in connection with the attack, two of whom had already confessed to the crime.

December 6 2004,9,15,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","Five Saudi militants attacked the US consulate in the Saudi port city of Jeddah. Saudi forces killed three of the militants and wounded the other two (one subsequently died of his wounds). The militants threw explosives at the gates of the walled consulate and then entered through the entrance used to deliver mail to the consulate, firing at the guards as they went. They had tried to enter in their car but were blocked by an automatic gate. About eighteen third-country nationals were taken hostage inside the consulate for some time, but were later released. Some reports indicated the hostages were used as human shields when the Saudi guards engaged the militants. American Marines and Saudi guards eventually repelled the militants. Five non-American employees were killed in the attack along with some Saudi security personnel. The victims were of several nationalities: one Yemeni, one Sudanese, one Filipino, a Pakistani, and a Sri Lankan. Several Saudi security personnel were also injured in the attack, along with more embassy personnel (two Yemenis, two Pakistanis, a Lebanese, a Filipino, an Indian, and Sri Lankan). Saudi sources said that several Saudi civilians were also hit by gunfire. Two Americans sustained slight injuries. Consulate workers reported that the militants entered one of the consulate buildings and began screaming: ""Where are the Americans?"" However, no Americans worked in that building. The attackers failed to reach the main building where Americans work. A Saudi group linked to Al-Qaeda, calling itself Qaeda al Jihad in the Arabian Peninsula, claimed responsibility for the attack on several Islamic websites. The group said that the attack had been organized by al-Qaeda. However, during the attack the hostage takers called Saudi officials and identified themselves as the Fallujah Brigades (this discrepancy is not yet addressed). The attack occurs exactly one year after the Interior Ministry took the step of listing twenty-six wanted terrorists linked to al-Qaeda. None of the attackers were on this list of most wanted terrorists.

January 16 2007,70,170,"Baghdad, Iraq: Three explosive devices, including one detonated by a suicide bomber, killed at least seventy students and injured as many as 170 others at Mustansiriya University in Baghdad. The attack occurred as students, the majority women, were leaving campus for the day. The first bomb exploded near the University's entrance and the second close to another exit. The suicide bomber was discovered by guards and detonated his device prematurely, killing himself but wounding only two people. Attacks on educational institutions are frequent in Iraq, as militants attempt to disrupt the country's reconstruction. This attack, however, may have also had sectarian motivations. Mustansiriya University's students are predominantly Shiite, many from the nearby neighborhood of Sadr City. Students report that the University has come under greater influence of Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, with some reporting deputies enforcing a strict Islamic dress code and monitoring of students' personal lives. These changes would make the campus a prime target for Sunni militants. The attack also occurred the day after Barzan Ibrahim Hasan and Awad Hamed Bandar, two high-level Sunni officials under Saddam Hussein, were executed for their involvement in the 1982 massacre of 148 Shiite men and boys in Dujail. Attacks were especially violent the day Hussein was executed in late December. It is significant to note that On 4 December 2006 Ansar al-Sunnah issued a video calling on Sunni students and professors to suspend all academic activities at Baghdad universities. The video denounced killings by death squads and asked those of all sects to abide by the decision. There is no indication that the group was involved in this attack, however.[12]"
